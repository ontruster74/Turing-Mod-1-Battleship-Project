# Turing-Mod-1-Battleship-Project

This is Sebastian McKee's and Rig Freyr's submission for the Turing Mod 1 Battleship Game project.

REFLECTION QUESTIONS
====================================


1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? 

  A: In the absence of an interaction pattern, we relied on the principles of TDD to build our Iteration 3 classes. We wrote tests from scratch after whiteboarding what functions each class would need and their respective outputs. Once we had completed our tests and grouped them into spec files, we began writing our class files accordingly.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

  A: The intelligent firing algorithm we added to our Computer player is incomplete--it functions, and effectively chooses targets during the game's runtime, but doesn't always verify whether it has sunk a ship or not. As such, there is a chance our computer will leave a ship only half-demolished before moving on to another target.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

  A: We exclusively used the Driver-Navigator pairing technique throughout this project, and found it a very effective vehicle for joint collaboration.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

  A: Because we did all of our project work cotemporaneously via Slack huddle, all of our feedback to one another was constant and immedate.
